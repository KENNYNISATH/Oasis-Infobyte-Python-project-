Oasis Infobyte Internship Project
(https://oasisinfobyte.com/)

Welcome to my internship project repository at Oasis Infobyte! During my time here, I worked on developing various applications including a Voice Assistant, BMI Calculator, Random Password Generator, and Basic Weather App.

Project Overview

This repository contains the code for the following projects:

Voice Assistant: This project involves building a voice-controlled assistant capable of performing various tasks based on user commands. It utilizes speech recognition and natural language processing techniques to understand and execute user requests.

BMI Calculator: The BMI Calculator is a simple application that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user-provided height and weight inputs. It helps users assess their body composition and health status.

Random Password Generator: This application generates strong, random passwords of variable lengths to enhance security for user accounts and sensitive information. Users can specify the length and complexity of the generated passwords.

Basic Weather App: The Basic Weather App fetches weather information based on user-provided location data. It retrieves current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and forecasts, using external APIs.

Technologies Used
Programming Languages: Python
Libraries/Modules: SpeechRecognition, NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit), Flask (for Basic Weather App), Requests (for API calls)
APIs: OpenWeatherMap API (for weather data retrieval)
Development Tools: Git, GitHub
